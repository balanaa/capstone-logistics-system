# PWA Camera Setup Guide

## Overview

The Cross-Port application now includes a PWA (Progressive Web App) camera feature accessible at `/camera`. This allows users to access camera functionality through a web browser and install the app on their mobile devices.

## Current Implementation

### Features

- ✅ Camera access with permission prompts
- ✅ Photo capture functionality
- ✅ Automatic photo download
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ PWA installation capability
- ✅ Service worker for offline functionality

### Technical Details

- **Route**: `/camera` (public access, no login required)
- **Service Worker**: Basic caching strategy implemented
- **Manifest**: Updated for Cross-Port branding
- **Camera API**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

## Testing Instructions

### Desktop Testing

1. Run the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/camera`
3. Click "Request Camera Access"
4. Allow camera permissions when prompted
5. Test photo capture functionality

### Mobile Testing (HTTPS Required)

**Important**: Camera access on mobile devices requires HTTPS in production environments.

#### Option 1: Local Development (Same Device)

- Use your mobile device's browser to access `http://[your-computer-ip]:3000/camera`
- This works for testing on the same network

#### Option 2: Production Build

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Serve the build folder with HTTPS
3. Access the HTTPS URL on mobile device
4. Test camera functionality and PWA installation

#### Option 3: Development with HTTPS

1. Install a local HTTPS certificate
2. Configure React development server for HTTPS
3. Access via HTTPS on mobile devices

### PWA Installation Testing

1. Open the app in a mobile browser (Chrome/Safari)
2. Look for "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Install the PWA
4. Test camera functionality from the installed app

## Known Limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working

- **Check HTTPS**: Ensure you're using HTTPS on mobile
- **Check Permissions**: Verify camera permissions are granted
- **Check Browser**: Ensure browser supports camera API
- **Check Device**: Verify device has a working camera

#### PWA Not Installing

- **Check Manifest**: Verify manifest.json is accessible
- **Check Service Worker**: Ensure service worker is registered
- **Check HTTPS**: PWA installation requires HTTPS
- **Check Browser**: Use Chrome/Safari for best PWA support

#### Service Worker Issues

- **Check Console**: Look for service worker errors
- **Check Network**: Verify service-worker.js is accessible
- **Check Production**: Service worker only works in production builds

### Debug Steps

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check Console for errors
3. Verify Network tab shows successful requests
4. Check Application tab for service worker status
5. Test camera permissions in browser settings
