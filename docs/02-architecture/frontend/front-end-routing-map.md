ProtectedRoute usage (plain text)

<Route path="/shipment" element={
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['shipment','admin','viewer']}>
<ShipmentList/>
</ProtectedRoute>
} />

Notes

- Always include 'admin'. Include 'viewer' for read-only access across routes.
- `analytics` role has been removed (replaced by viewer + admin).
- Sidebar hides links the user doesn't have roles for. Admin and Viewer see all sidebar links. Employees with multiple department roles do not see a Dashboard tab or Analytics tab.
- User Management icon is in the Header (with the "circle-user" icon), visible to admin and viewer only.
- Route params should use the visible segment `pro-number` and the param name `:proNo` (e.g., `/shipment/pro-number/PRO-0001`).
